I’m very happy to have completed this project. It helped me a lot in learning programming.💻

The project is a console-based banking system 🏦designed to simulate basic banking operations.
Its main idea is to manage users and accounts while allowing common transactions such as login, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers through a simple menu-driven interface. 
This helped me understand how real-world systems can be modeled using code.

The first time, I built the project using procedural programming, which was very challenging😄.
The second time, I rebuilt the same project using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and the experience was much better and easier✅.
OOP made the development process clearer, more structured, and easier to maintain.

Through this project, I learned important concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, 
and the importance of maintaining data privacy🔒.

Overall, this project gave me a strong foundation and good preparation before starting my Data Structures course.
 
Any feedback is welcome 🤗
